## Detects On

This property is used to determine which HTML element should catch mouse interaction.

The valid values are:

-   `"canvas"`: Only the particles canvas will be targeted
-   `"parent"`: Only the particles canvas parent will be targeted
-   `"window"`: The full window will be targeted, this will work perfectly with a negative z-index positioned canvas
