= 2.5.1 =

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with ES modules

= 2.4.0 =

## New Features

- Added `reset` method to updaters, this method will be called after a particle loses a life.
- Created the motion plugin for handling motion sickness, I moved this feature from the engine to a plugin since I prefer to have it more customizable. Everyone now can create their own motion sickness plugin, instead of having a standard behavior for everyone
- Added mutation observer to avoid style changes to the canvas when the `fullScreen` option is enabled (default behavior)
- Moved all easing functions to plugin packages, slim now depends on easing-quad since it's the default value used in repulse and attract
- Added support for multiline text in canvas mask text options, separator and spacing are customizable values
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to canvas element, fixes #4785
- Removed all canvas context save/restore calls, this should be a huge improvement to general performances
- Added the particles pool for reusing destroyed particles, every tsParticles instance will have its own pool
- Changed collision absorb code, added `absorb.speed` option to `collisions` section
- Added delay to root options, fixes #4766

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed infection plugin
- Fixed issue with polygon mask when particles bounce on the polygon edges
- Fixed issue with `rgb()`, `hsl()` and `hsv()` values in color option values

## Other Changes

- Refactored plugins to avoid passing options in init functions since it's no more necessary
- Removed `initAsync` function from plugins, standard `init` is now async for all plugins
- Removed polygon mask plugin from the `tsparticles` package, this is a breaking change only for those that are using it. Since it's a heavy plugin and not so much used, I have preferred removing it from the `tsparticles` package.
- Changed tsconfig target from es6 to es2019 (less transpilation to a reasonable target). The compatibility is still very high, reducing the bundle size.
